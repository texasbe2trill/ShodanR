Question 11 What happened to my computer
I cannot access my files and they have changed their extension
Answer 1 Your files have been encrypted by Redeemer, a Darknet ransomware operation.
(Question 2 Is there any way to recover my files2
(Answer 2 Yes, you can recover your files. This will however cost you money in Monero (XMR).
(Question 3) Is there any way to recover my files without paying
(Answer 3 Without paying for the proper decryption key, you will NEVER regain access to your
files.
Redeemer uses the most secure algorithms and a sophisticated encryption scheme which
guarantees security.
Ever since Redeemer was first released publicly (vMay 2021) no one managed to crack the
decryption or
recover their files without paying."
